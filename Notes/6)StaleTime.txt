staleTime is the length of time before your data becomes stale.


The default value in React Query is staleTime: 0 - which means your data is immediately stale! 
In React Query, your data can be fresh or stale.
If it's fresh, the saved (cached) data will be used repeatedly, without more API calls to the server.

To use stale time we pass it to the third arugument object in useQueryHook

{
....
staleTime : 1000,

}
