What is cache?
    > Cache stores the recent data that the user searched or navigate
        and stores it.
    > By doing this the item will only fetch one time, If we navigate to
        another page are re-navigate to the same page.

    > You can find the difference using dev tools
        > Inspect and slow down the network conncetion speed.
        > Open Network tab
        > In traditional method you can absorve, when ever we navigate to the page,
            A new request is sent.
        > But where as in React Query the data is only fetched one time,
            This is because RQ uses caching(Mostly holds data for 5 min default).

How RQ cache works? 
    > When the intial fetching "isLoading" is set to true.
    > When the data is fetched successfully, The data is stored in the cache.
    > Thus if we navigate to the same page, the data is not fetched again because
        RQ first searches the data in Cache with the help of Unique Key.
    > If there is a change in data RQ updates the data respectfully by executing background re-fetch.
        (isFetching it the parameter related background re-fetching)
    
    > There is an another case
        Lets say the data got updated when we navigate to the page.
        Instead of showing loading text, RQ first renders the cached data
        and gets updated to new data when background fetch in done.

Why RQ cache ? 
    It helps for better user experience


We can also change the cache time 
    To change cacheTime, pass the third parameter to useQuery hook

useQuery('name', fetchingFuntionwhichReturnsPromise,
    {
        cacheTime : 5000,
    }
)
