Scinerio : In some cases we need to use mulitiple useQuery Hooks.

-> How to Use muliple useQuery Hooks

    We Do the same logic as before,
    But to use multiple we use Alias for the parameters for each useQuery Hook

Setup : 
> Create a route for parallel query


Note : 
    To use  parameters of multipl parallel queries,
    we use alias as show below

    const {data : myData} = useQuery(...)
    const {data : myData2} = useQuery(...)

    Now we can use myData , myData2 without any confilt.
