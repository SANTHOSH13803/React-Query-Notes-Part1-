                React Query

-> What is React Query?
    A lib for fetching data in React application.

-> Why we need React Query? 
    > React is UI lib, There is no specific pattern for data fetching.
    > We use useEffect hook and useStateHooks to maintain component state like loading,Error or resulting data.
    > If the data is needed throughout the app, we tend to use state management libraries.

    >> What is important to note here is the state management tools are
        good with working with the client state(Eg., Theme, Modal open or not).

        **But it's "not great for working with async operations or server state".
        
        Using normal data fetching for the async operations gives us a lot of challenges(Problems) while we have to deal with
        caching,Deduping multiple requests for the same data, updating state data in the background, performance optimizations(paginations and lazy lodaing) etc.

        To simplify this process we use React Query.



* Client State:
    Perisited in your app memory and acessing or updating it is synchronous.

* Server State : 
    > Perisited remotely(database) and requires asyc APIs for fetching and updating.
    > Has shared ownership.
    > Data can be updated by someone.
    > UI data may not be in sync with the remote data.


What we learn here? 

    > Basic queries
    > Poll data
    > RQ dev tools
    > Create Reusable query hooks for data fetching
    > Query by ID
    > Parallel queries
    > Dynamic queries
    > Dependent queries
    > Infinite and paginated queries


    For data updations
        > update data using mutations
        > Invalidate queries
        > Optimistic updates
        > Axios interceptor
