If this is true(default) -> Data will be refetched when we revisits the page.

If this is false -> Data will be refetched when we revisits the page.


> refetchOnWindowFocus : 

If this is true(default) -> Data will be refetched when we revisits the page.
(This difference is seen when ever we update the data,
 In traditional method the updated data doesn't reflect,
 Whereas in RQ, If refetchOnWindowFocus is enabled the data gets updated )
 

If this is false -> Data will be refetched when we revisits the page.
