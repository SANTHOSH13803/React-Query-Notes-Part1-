Display each super user details

Project Setup : 

s1 : Create a new route"Query By ID"

S2 : For each super heros create a seperate route by dynamic id

See the Query by ID you will understand easily.


We have written a custom hook(useSuperHeroData),

In the unique ID place we passed an array,

This is because if we don't pass the like above mentioned.
In cache The superheroes of first items will be saved not the others.
