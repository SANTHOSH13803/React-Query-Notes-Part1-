> In this slide one of the parameter(id) of the first query is 
Dependent on second query


* Scenerio : 
    > Let's say we have a youtube channel
    > Each user is login option
    > Each user offers some courses in the channel

    So in db.json we put some dummy data for our example
    
      "users": [
            {
            "id": "santhosh@example.com",
            "channelId": "Santhosh Tech"
            }
        ], 
        "channels": [
            {
            "id": "Santhosh Tech",
            "courses": ["React", "MUI", "Node JS", "JavaScript"]
            }
        ]

* Code implementation: 
    > Create an route and page for DependentQuery.
    > Pass the gmail to the DependentQuery route
    > First get the details of the user
    > Destructure the channelId from the user
    > use "enabled" in third arugement,when undefined put false else true
    > By channelId fetchCourse details
