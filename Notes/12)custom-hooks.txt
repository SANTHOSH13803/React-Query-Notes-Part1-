Sometimes we need to fetch the same data repeatedly in different components, 
Instead of copy paste the code.
    We can reduce the code by implementing code logic as a hook.

we write all the code logic and export the hook.
Thus we can use it in different components.

The best convention to use custom hooks is it should have "use" as prefix.
