As we can see in the mutation, we need to click or "Fetch Heros" button to display the newly added hero

So to avoid this we QueryInvalidation

By QueryInvalidation the query gets refeched again with fresh updated data.

-> How to use it ? 
        > In useMutation hook ,pass an object as second arugument.
        
        Syntax :
        // invalidation 
            {
                onSuccess: () => {
                    queryClient.invalidateQueries("super-heroes");
                    // the key should be same as the fetcher funtion
                    // invalidateQueries removes the unique key from the cache,
                        so the RQ checks the key is present in the cache, if not it fetchs the data again
                },
            }
