If there are more than one user that should be shown at a time,
we can't use useQuery because it voilates the rules of the hooks.

To avoid this problem RQ provides useQueries Hook 

Syntax : useQueries(herosId.map(id => {
    return {
        queryKey :['super-hero',id], 
        queryFn : () => fetchSuperHero(id)
    }
}))


useQueries return an array of query results.
