-> What is polling? 
    Polling is the process of fetching data in regular intervals.
    (Eg : Real time price of a product).

-> refetchInterval : 
    When we specified the refetchInterval to our code.
    for every time inteval specified, The data gets refetched.

    {
        refetchInterval : 2000 // for every 2 sec query gets refetched
    }

// Note : The main point to remember is the data won't be refetched 
            when the page loses focus.

To continue to refetched data in background we can use below property

-> refetchIntervalInBackground : This will continue to fetch data even the browser is not in focus.


// Polling is generally used in applications when data changes continuously
