---- Data Transformation ---

-> useQuery provides fetched data, for some case we want to modify the data
    fetched we use "select" property in third arguments.

Syntax :  In 3rd argument of useQuery

    select: (data) => {
        return data.data.map((each) => each.name);
    },

By doing this instead of giving all the data from the fetched API,
useQuery gives the modified data(select key data(ie,only superHerosName)).
