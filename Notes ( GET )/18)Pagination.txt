First Steps :
> In db.json add colors
> Create a component and route related to paginatedQueries
> Fetch the color using useQuery Hook
// Point to remember : 
    Json-server provide limit and offset by default we can use them by following below syntax

    http://localhost:4000/colors?_limit=2&_page=3

    "_" mukyam bigileee.....

    By above syntax ,This for each page there are 2 colors.

    1,2 -> 1st page
    2,3 -> 2nd page
    4,5 -> 3rd page and so-on...

> Simple we need to maitain the "page" by using useState
> The limit and offset should be done at backend part (Here json server support pagintaion as shown above)

> By below url json-server paginates in the backend
        `http://localhost:4000/colors?_limit=2&_page=${page}`

> For better UI performance we provide "keepPreviousData = true" to the third argument in useQuery
    This make perivous data show on the UI until the new data is fetched
