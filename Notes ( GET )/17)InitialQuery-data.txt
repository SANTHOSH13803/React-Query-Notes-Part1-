Most common use case : In movies application we have "Movie Name","Poster" and "rating" appeared on the all movies page,
                        we can use those in the detailed movies page. 

Scenerio : When we fetch a data in a component and some of the 
            data is used in the child component, we can pass the the fetched data to the child component,
            Thus it avoid loading and provides better user experience.
Note :  To get additional data of the component we need to do another api call in the child,
            So the fetched data in child overwrite the initial values.

Example : In our app "Query By ID" component fetches the all the heros data.
        -> We can use these data as initial values(which is cached data from parent component) in RQsuperHero.js page

Setup : 
        > Set up the network speed to slow 3g

Implementation : 
    > We are fetching the inital values of "Query By ID" page and using it in useSuperHeroData hook
    > We need to pass the 'initialData' to the third parameter.
    > It accepts a funtion
    > we use "useQueryClient" which is a hook provided by react-query,
        by using this we can access the queries data of other component

        syn : const queryClient = useQueryClient();

    > To the third arugument 
            useQuery(["super-hero", HeroID], fetchSuperHero, {
            initialData: () => {
                const hero = queryClient
                    .getQueryData("super-heros")
                    ?.data?.find((hero) => hero.id === parseInt(HeroID));
                if (hero) {
                    return {
                    data: hero,
                    };
                } else {
                    return undefined;
                }
                },
            });
